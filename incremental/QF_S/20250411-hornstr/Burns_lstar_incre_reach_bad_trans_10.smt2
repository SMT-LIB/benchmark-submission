Application: Using String Solvers to solve RMC problems encoded as CHC over Strings
Target solver: cvc5, OSTRICH, Z3, Z3alpha, Z3-noodler
Time limit: 60.0
Benchmarks are extracted by running HornStr https://arg-git.informatik.uni-kl.de/pub/string-chc-lib on all benchmarks
provided in the repository and gathering the string queries sent to the string solvers.
